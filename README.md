# ðŸŒ¸ "Loves Me, Loves Me Not" Game
<br>
This game is a digital recreation of the classic "loves me, loves me not" game, where every petal of your flower determines whether your love is true! Ready to test fate?

How to Play:
Input the number of petals:

Enter a number when prompted that represents how many petals your flower has.
The game always starts with "loves me."
Petal by petal outcome:

The game will alternate between "loves me" and "loves me not" for each petal.
Watch as each petal is plucked one-by-one.
The final petal's twist:

The last petal reveals your true fate! It will dramatically shout:
"LOVES ME" (if love is true).
"LOVES ME NOT" (if love is not meant to be).
Features:
If you input a non-numeric value, the game will prompt you again to provide a valid number.
Suspense builds with a slight delay between petals as fate unfolds!
Try it out, and see if your true love is really true! ðŸ’–
